        <p>I combined several different recipes to create this shrimp and mushroom Alfredo pasta dish — it's definitely a winner. Garnish with chopped parsley.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) box dry fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups butter, divided</li>
            <li>

                1 pint heavy whipping cream
                </li>
            <li>

                ¾ cup grated Romano cheese
                </li>
            <li>

                ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
                </li>
            <li>

                3 cloves garlic, crushed, divided
                </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>

                2 tablespoons olive oil
                </li>
            <li>

                1 large onion, chopped
                </li>
            <li>

                8 ounces diced mushrooms
                </li>
            <li>

                1 (8 ounce) package frozen shrimp, deveined and tails removed, thawed
                </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over medium heat. Stir in fettuccine, return to a boil, and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li>
            
            <li>While the fettuccine is cooking, heat 1 cup butter and cream in a large saucepan over medium heat. When butter melts, add Romano, Parmesan, 1/3 of the garlic, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until cheese melts and sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            
            <li>At the same time, heat remaining 1/4 cup butter and olive oil in another saucepan over medium heat. When butter melts, add onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms and remaining garlic; increase the heat to medium-high and cook until mushrooms are soft, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp and cook until bright pink on the outside and opaque in the center, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Fold shrimp mixture into sauce. Add drained fettuccine and toss to coat.</li> </p>
        </ol>
